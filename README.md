# Netflix-Clone

I created this project to learn and master various technologies including React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS. It features JWT and cookie-based authentication, API fetching, and is deployed on Render.com.

You can view the live demo of the application [here](https://netflix-clone-p05i.onrender.com).
